# Workforce Productivity Prediction in Garment Industry

This repository contains the project files for predicting workforce productivity in a garment manufacturing industry. The analysis is performed using machine learning models developed in Python.

## Project Files

- **`garments_worker_productivity.csv`**: This is the dataset used for training and testing the models. It contains key features related to worker performance and productivity.
- **`Predicitng workforce productivity in garment industry.ipynb`**: A Jupyter Notebook file containing the primary code for data exploration, model training, and evaluation. This notebook demonstrates the complete workflow of the prediction process.
- **`workforce productivity-30 code.ipynb`**: A supplementary Jupyter Notebook with a streamlined version of the code, possibly focusing on a specific model or a more concise implementation.
- **`DL Documentation.pdf`**: The official project documentation that provides a detailed overview of the methodology, algorithms, and results.

## Getting Started

To run the analysis and reproduce the results, you will need to have Python and Jupyter installed. The following libraries are also required:

* **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
* **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
* **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning models and evaluation metrics.
* **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization.

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
